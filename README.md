# Artificial-Neural-Networks-for-Microstrip
Training a Neural Network to learn the behavior and characteristics of Microstrip. 
The extent of deviation of predicted output from the actual output was measured in terms of maximum error percentage and average error percentage.
The primary goal was to determine how well an algorithm worked for a particular transmission line and which was the best suited algorithm for each transmission line based on Error Percentage.

Algorithms used:
Backpropagation,
Linear Regression,
Logistic Regression,
MLP Classifier,
SGD Regression,

Transmission Lines considered:
Microstrip,
Slotline,
Stripline,
Co-Planar Waveguide(CPW),
Co-Planar Strip(CPS),
Microstrip Patch Antenna.
